            I am a Software Engineer passionate about making complex websites/apps
            easy and accessible to the user. Having worked as a Software Engineer for companies such as Novatic Labs and Change The Block,
            I have developed strong experience in Front-End, Back-End, web servers and web deployment. Moreover,
            In 2021 I founded a Crypto start-up where I enhanced my
            knowledge in the Web Development field in order to build a unique and robust product that
            would satisfy all users. I have experience in leading Web Development projects with teams
            of full-stack developers. I consider myself to be a quick learner eager to master new coding
            languages and make an impact in society through the use of technology! ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€
